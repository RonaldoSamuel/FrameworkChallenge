# FrameworkChallenge

This Project was made as a challenge for the company Framework as a metod to validate my self.

I will explain how this project work.

When you open the app for the first time the app grab the items from the api and save in a local database that will be consumed later. if the user open the app another time insted of save the items again, the app will only update the informations to sincronize if the new data grabed.

# Concept of the app

The layout of the app was first designed in a website called "Figma" that can help you to make a quick prototype for your project.
